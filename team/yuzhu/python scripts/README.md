# Python scripts of Yuzhu

This is python script collection of Yuzhu, which includes three parts: A/B testing, price points analysis and others (commission comparison). She put it here so that the info does not go lost.



## A/B testing
In this folder you could see concrete analysis for APAC tests: surge and MOV test in SG, or DBDF test in HK of year 2020.
The script final_edited_version is a script which Nina and Yuzhu have worked together for a standardized A/B test significance check script.

*Note*: If you have any questions about A/B testing or A/B testing analysis using python, Nina Ezhelenko of the global pricing team is the one you should contact.

## Price points analysis
The price points analysis is used to see what delivery fee a user from a geopoint could see using customer location and porygon shape info of vendors. 
The script is an analysis done using DAS data before DPS time and adjusted to needs of different countries, therefore you see different versions of the script. It could be also be used for "spreading the butter" project.

## Other
* Commission comparison
There are different source of commission data in pandata and central data warehouse. Yuzhu compared two different sources and found out that the differences are not so big except for certain countries. So data science team could use central data warehouse commission data for their models
