## What is this for?

As of 2023Q2, Significance at Target Group is not included in the main DPS Significance Pipeline. This code contains
the logic/dag to calculate significance at that level and make it available in the QDD.

## How to use it


If you want to run it locally, you'd need to install the required libraries in the requirements.txt and also
have available a credentials.json file to authenticate yourself against Google. Assuming you've met the pre-requisities, replace the credentials path to your own in the app.py file.  

To run the script, set your working directory to this folder, place yourself in the terminal, and run

```
python app.py
```
